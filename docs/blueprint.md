## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Electric blue (#007BFF) to represent innovation and digital expertise. It should stand out prominently across the platform.
- Background color: Dark gray (#222222) to provide a sleek, modern aesthetic that draws focus to content. It also helps reduce eye strain during prolonged use.
- Accent color: Vibrant lime green (#32CD32) for interactive elements like buttons, links, and active states. It provides clear visual cues for user interaction.
- Body and headline font: 'Roboto', a grotesque-style sans-serif font, to offer a balance of modern appeal and readability across different screen sizes.
- Use a set of meticulously designed line-style icons that clearly represent electronics components, music notations, web elements, and sports equipment.
- Implement a responsive, grid-based layout with high contrast to ensure elements are easily discernible and accessible on any device.
- Subtle, yet noticeable animations for button presses, loading states, and transitions to enhance user experience without being distracting.
- Use a secondary color palette with lighter shades of gray (#444444, #666666) and stark white (#FFFFFF) to differentiate content blocks.
- Employ varying font weights (300, 400, 700) to create clear hierarchical structures, distinguishing between headings, subheadings, and body text.
